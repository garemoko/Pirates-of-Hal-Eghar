# Pirates of Hal'Eghar - Summary
Pirates of Hal'Eghar is an open source dunegon crawler with a twist: instead of exploring dark dunegons filled with monsters and treasures, you and your party will explore sunny islands and deep blue seas (also filled with monsters and treasures). 

## Game Board
Game play takes place on a large hexagonal grid. At the start of each game, players can see the areas of the map occupied by sea and land. As players explore areas of land additional segments are overlayed on the base board, revealing the features of that part of the island.

Each player character and ship on the board also has a card which displays relevant stats and can be used to track health points, equipment and effects. 

## Game System
In Pirates of Hal'Eghar, one player acts as the Naval Commander, controlling the various npcs and revealing the scenario as it unfolds. Each other player controls a member of a crew seeking treasure and adventure. Players take turns to move their characters and perform actions such as:

* attacking
* firing a canon
* steering a ship
* opening a treaure chest

Players in the grid square behind a canon or in front of the rudder of a ship are considered in control of that ship. When steering a ship, players can either increase or decrease the speed of the ship by one level. Ships can be anchored, moving at half speed, or moving at half speed. For moving ships, the player can also adjust the direction of the ship by 60 degrees. Ships can face in any of the six directions represented by the hexagonal grid. 

## Player Characters
Different characters have traits and stats that make them more or less suited to different tasks. These traits and stats can be augmented by equipment that the characters collect. Characters that survive a scenario take their equipment and any treasure they collect with them into the next scenario.

## Scenarios
A carefully designed scenario is required to play Pirates of Hal'Eghar. Scenarios can either be island explorations, sea battles, or some other type of adventure. Scenarios can either be co-operative, competitive, or a mixture of both. 

All secnarios consist of:
* An introductory story and briefing.
* At least one objective with outcomes relating to meeting or failing the objective(s).
* A map including details of any ships, canons, npcs, equipment and treaure.
* Any events that happen on specific turns, or time limits for objectives.
* Any special rules related to elements of that scenario.

## Build it yourself
Aside from commonly available gaming equipment (such as six sided dice), everything needed to play Pirates of Hal'Eghar can be printed on a 2d printer. However, the game experienced may be enhanced through the use of 3d models where possible. Pirates of Hal'Eghar is designed to be as accessible as possible for new players, while allowing for a depth and variety that more experienced players appreciate.

## Extensibility
As an open source board game, Pirates of Hal'Eghar is designed to be extensible so you can design your own scenarios, character types and rules expansions, or modify existing ones.
